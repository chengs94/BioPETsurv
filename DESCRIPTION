Description: Prognostic Enrichment is a clinical trial strategy of evaluating an intervention in a patient population with a higher rate of the unwanted clinical event than the broader patient population (R. Temple (2010) DOI:10.1038/clpt.2010.233). A higher event rate translates to a lower sample size for the clinical trial, which can have both practical and ethical advantages.
    This package provides tools to evaluate biomarkers for prognostic enrichment of clinical trials with survival/time-to-event outcomes.
